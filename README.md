Assignment part-1
My program consists of the application of opencv to create an efficient code for goal line technology, that is used in football to detect if the ball has entirely crossed the goal line.
The code in the file goal_line_tech.py can be used to detect a goal for a stationary image, whereas the code in the file webcam_goal_line_tech.py can be used to detect a goal in a live video feed
The code uses a stationary goalline whose coordinates are fixed and checks for the last edge of the football if it has crossed the line towards the lines left.
